## 🚀 About Me

🕵️‍♂ My name is Minh, I'm from Vietnam 🇻🇳 and working as a Software Engineer for an Australian 🇦🇺 company.

💻 My job mainly involves AI development, especially building Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

☀️ In my free time, I love building side projects related to AI applications. My most recent project is [Formularizer](https://formularizer.com), which works as an AI assistant for Excel & Google Sheets.

📘 I also write a blog to share my knowledge and experience in NextJs, Python, etc. at [dminhvu.com](https://dminhvu.com). I got a blog post with 12k+ views about [Next.js SEO](https://dminhvu.com/post/nextjs-seo).
